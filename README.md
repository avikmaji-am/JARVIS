# 🤖 JARVIS – Voice Assistant

**JARVIS** is a Python-based intelligent voice assistant that enables users to control various system functions, browser activities, and music playback through natural voice commands. The project focuses on creating a hands-free and efficient user experience by automating common tasks on the computer.

JARVIS uses offline speech recognition, allowing it to function even without an internet connection. It can open, close, and minimize applications, manage browser tabs, scroll web pages, control system sound, and play or pause music. Additionally, it includes specialized automation features for Instagram, making it a versatile automation tool built entirely with Python.
